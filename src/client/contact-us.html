Our goal is to serve this country with burgers, fries, and those sweet home runs. And while we keep that good Game Day taste in mouths across the tri-state, Game Day Grill has a humble, country-folk beginning."

            <h2>Party Room Reservations</h2>
            <p>
                Want to reserve a party room? Party rooms are only to be reserved for times within store hours. If
                another party room is booked on the day you want to book yours, the party you book must start at least
                two hours after the previous one ended, or two hours before the other one starts, so our staff can
                recuperate, prepare, and provide you the best possible service. To reserve a party room, a two week
                notice is needed. Rates run at $11.99/per kid under 12, and $14.99/per adult. You can reserve a party
                room by contacting us through our email or phone number.
            </p>

                Below is our Party Room Calendar. You can see what nearby times and dates currently have a booked party
                room. Our Party Room Calendar is updated every single hour.
